## Principles

The k8gb project community adheres to the following principles:

- Open: k8gb is open source.
- Welcoming and inclusive: See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Transparent and accessible: Any changes to k8gb's source code and collaborations on the project are publicly accessible (GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions).
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.
- Vendor-neutral: k8gb is vendor-neutral as defined by [What it Means to be a Vendor Neutral Project in the CNCF](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).

## Code of Conduct

k8gb follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is aligned with the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Contributors

Anyone can contribute to the k8gb project. More about contribution rules and technical aspects can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are defined in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file by their GitHub user handles.
New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and are elected by a supermajority of votes of existing maintainers.
If a maintainer is no longer able to perform their duties, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status.
Maintainers can be also removed from the active maintainers list by a supermajority of votes of existing maintainers.

Below is the list of a maintainer's general responsibilities in addition to those defined for project contributors:

- Triages GitHub issues
- Reviews pull requests
- Runs k8gb releases
- Forms k8gb architecture, strategy and roadmap
- Actively supports the k8gb community in related channels
- Represents the k8gb project in public media (events, slack channels, etc.)
- Is involved in CNCF-related activities and projects
- Ensures compliance with CNCF guidelines
- Owns project infrastructure

## Project Lead

The Project Lead is a project maintainer with the final vote on project decisions.

## Conflict Resolutions

In most cases, it is expected that conflicts are amicably resolved by involved parties.
In cases of escalation, conflicts are resolved by voting, with the ruling of a supermajority of votes of project maintainers. The project lead has the final vote on the ruling.

## Changes

Project Governance is a living document.
All key project changes including changes in project governance can be proposed by a GitHub PR and then reviewed and voted on by project maintainers.
